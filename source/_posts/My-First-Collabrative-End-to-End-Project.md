This is my first blog and I am very excited to share my experience with everyone.

It was week 11 and we were done with front-end, now the time was to implement the same learning in building a product.

### Why did we choose this?

There were many platforms where you can give a test and evaluate yourself but there is no such platform where you can create your test and share the same among your circle to evaluate them. So, we took this challenge and started our "First Collaborative End-to-End Project".

I got the project and Karthik was my parthner. We were very excited and nervous. New experience and exposure to work in a group there was a lot to learn and fear that how will I make it to work and the duration to complete this was 1 week.

New day new start new project many things were there to do and started with thinking what all need to be there in the project how the flow should be and made DFD (data flow diagram) using (draw.io) and got to know the flow of the project. After that started working on mock-ups did use Figma and made the complete UI designs. Planned everything when what and how it should be done. Raised issue with what needs to be done, when need to be done and by whom.

it was day 3 started with the setting up the development environment with Airbnb's style guides for ReactJs. We started working on UI as it was planned and assigned. By the end of the day, all UI pages were ready with the flow. We were a bit relaxed that yes things are moving as per our plan and we will finish it off by the deadline.

Days were passing we were learning things implementing the concepts and moving forward with marathon mindset. It was 4th day and from the afternoon started implementing redux in our project and completed it with all the functionalities offline to check the data flow. Once the flow was ready and the product was in working condition we moved ahead to implement the firebase but this was a bit hard to implement as the concept was new and there was pressure to complete the product with the maximum functionalities.

### New day new concept to learn and work with new challenge !!

It’s Day-5 and that’s when we started to look into Firebase. Firebase is a BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) by Google which helps us to implement easy and simple MVPs (Minimal Viable Product). We spent almost the entire day till evening in learning firebase and implemented firebase and made a small TODO and user authentication page. Now the concept was cleared how it works but still, long way to go and already 5th day was over.

Started a fresh day with a fresh mind and it was day 6 from there we started implementing firebase in the product and faced many real product challenges in connecting a product to the database. I am thankful to my partner who was there to tackle the things and manage everything and meanwhile where ever I was getting stuck he was helping me to come out from there. Now the product was ready with 50% completion whatever we decided to do. Only one day was there and still many things were pending then we worked till morning and finished the product. From the last 2 nights, we didn't sleep and there was zeal to complete the product and we worked with full dedication until we achieved it.

### Last Day

With lots of dedication and hard work and I must planning was proper so we completed our project demonstrated and got very good feedback and we were happy that we completed it.

#### YES WE DID IT !!

#### Key things I Learnt

- Start planning properly what to do, when to do and how much to do.
- If you are learning a new concept then only refer the documentation and implement the same on a small project before implementing it into your real product.
